		Instructions how to play Minions for Winions		
	</h1>
	<br>
	<div id="instruct">	
		<p>
			Before starting the game you have to select which player will play the first set. 
			After this the players have to enter their names. Once the names are filled in the game can start.			
			<strong>Minions for Winions</strong> is a turn-based game where each
			player has a turn and this keeps going on until there are four minions of the same color on a straight line. When this condition
			is met then that player wins. The winner's name and number of moves from the start is entered in the players database.	
			There will be an alert box popping out and showing which player won and with how many moves. Once the user clicks "Ok" the game restarts.

				A special move made by the other player cannot be removed by using the undo move.

					The Shoot move removes all the minions in a vertical line. To activate this move the player has to activate it and
					click on a column on the board. This move can be used once and cannot be "undoed".

				The Bomb move removes all the minions around the area where the bomb is dropped. To activate this move the player has to activate it and
